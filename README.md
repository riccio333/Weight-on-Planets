Hello,

I haved fun creating this program. It all started with me reading an article on the web talking about the satellite of Saturn, Titan.

I thought, how much would I weigh on Titan? I searched on Internet, but i don't found any site that calculates how much you weight on Titan.

So I said: "but why don't I try to create a program that tells me how much I weigh on the various planets and major satellites?" and here we are.

In this program you can calculate your weight on:

-Mercury

-Venus

-Moon

-Mars

-Phobos

-Deimos

-Jupiter

-Io

-Europa

-Ganymede

-Callisto

-Saturn

-Titan

-Rhea

-Iapetus

-Mimas

-Uranus

-Titania

-Neptune

-Triton

-Pluto

Have fun!
